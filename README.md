- # TWITTER-MOCKUP
- How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.<br>
We each split up into two and three members inorder to accomplish each criteria. There were
two people working on the front end design and input of the look for the website. The design was made in
figma and implement it to code after that the tweeting was implented to be placed in the middle
of the main home page of the website by placing tweets inside a container and the buttons for like and follow was added near the posts. After that the implementaion of the API and was made by three members to integrate and apply accounts and user registration on login and user name to be displayed on about you and on posts.

- Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?<br>
We used fetching for the usernames, for posts and followers 

- What was your inspiration for the design of the website?<br>
The design was made simple but also at the same time we keep on looking back to back on twitter to get more of a idea how it should look like for the UI and idea how the posts will be placed. We made the design to be simple enough to be also be implemented and not have much of a hard time getting all of the elements into placed but we made the UI to have a look of some kind of pop-ish looking with thick elements and black outlines

- What was your approach in creating the content of the website?<br>
We started with the design and tackled the inputs and the tweeting of posts and after the 2 members for designing they pass it onto the three members to implement the API

Quite hard to say how our website is creative as we made it simple to be a mockup of a twitter the only unique thing is how the UI is designed to have a pop look and a thick look
  
- What did you use to deploy your website?<br>
We used github to deply out website
  
- How you worked as a team to accomplish the project<br>
By deviding the tasks with one another and be on a call and communicate with each other and update with one another often
  
- How did you divide the tasks between the team, and what is the responsibility of each one?<br>
We divided the task by having two members work on the front end design and input for the website and three members to work for the API integration for the accounts and log in
  
- How did you prevent your changes in code from conflicting with each other?<br>
We went into a call inorder to communicate easily with one anoter and constant updates with the commit and push we do.

The design was made very simple so we want to improve on that to have more of a professional look and work on grabbing info of the posts, likes and follow to be showed up.
